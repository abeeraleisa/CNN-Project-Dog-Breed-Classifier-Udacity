# Project Overview:


In this project I have learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.

# Dog Breed Classifier in PyTorch
This is a repo for the Dog Breed Classifier Project  in Udacity Nanodegree

It is implemented by using PyTorch library.
